## 🔧 What I'm Working On

- 📊 **Log Analysis Projects** using Splunk, Windows Event Logs, and Sysmon
- 📡 **Network Traffic Analysis** with Wireshark and Packet Tracer
- 🐧 **Linux-based Security Monitoring** using tools like `auditd`, AIDE, and file integrity systems

## 🧠 Current Learning Focus

- SIEM analysis with Splunk and Elastic Stack (ELK)
- Host-based intrusion detection using Sysmon and Sigma rules
- Network monitoring with Wireshark and Zeek
- Log forensics in Windows and Linux environments
