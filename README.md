# 👋 Hi, I'm Francis Olorunfemi Jacob

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast with a growing focus on Blue Team operations, including log analysis, intrusion detection, and network monitoring. My learning journey is hands on, and i document every project here from packet tracing and log parsing to Linux security hardening.

## 💼 What I'm Working On

- 🔒 **Blue Team Projects**  
  Practical defensive cybersecurity tasks using tools like `auditd`, `chkrootkit`, and `AIDE` on Linux.

- 📊 **Log & Event Monitoring**  
  Collecting and analyzing logs using `Splunk`, `Wireshark`, and native Linux tools (`auth.log`, `audit.log`).

- 🖥️ **Network Analysis**  
  Simulating networks and exploring vulnerabilities via `Cisco Packet Tracer` and `Wireshark`.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- `Kali Linux`, `Ubuntu`, `VirtualBox`
- `Wireshark`, `Splunk`, `ELK Stack`
- `auditd`, `chkrootkit`, `AIDE`
- `Python (beginner level)`
- Git & GitHub for documentation and collaboration
